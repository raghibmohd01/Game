Multi-Game System is a versatile gaming project in C++ using the graphics.h library, featuring three classic games: Snake, Sudoku, and a Number Puzzle. This project showcases a blend of logic, problem-solving, and interactive gameplay, all presented through custom-designed graphical interfaces.

Key features include:

Snake Game: Implemented the iconic Snake game where the player controls a growing snake, aiming to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body. The game includes dynamic gameplay with increasing difficulty as the snake grows.

Sudoku: Created a fully functional Sudoku game that generates puzzles for the player to solve. The game includes error-checking mechanisms and a user-friendly interface for number input and navigation.

Number Puzzle Game: Developed a sliding tile puzzle where players must arrange numbers from 1 to 14 within a 4x4 grid. The game challenges players to think critically and strategize their moves to solve the puzzle efficiently.

This project demonstrates proficiency in C++ programming and a strong understanding of game development concepts, including graphical rendering, user input handling, and game state management.
